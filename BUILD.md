# Build Instructions

This guide covers how to set up the development environment and build Legato from source on Windows.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
- [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
- Microsoft C++ Build Tools: Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ development
  tools, or Visual Studio Build Tools 2019/2022
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (must be on `PATH`):

  ```powershell
  winget install Kitware.CMake
  ```

- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) from LunarG — required to
  build the Vulkan GPU backend (`vulkan-shaders-gen` needs the SDK's headers
  and `glslc`):

  ```powershell
  winget install KhronosGroup.VulkanSDK
  ```

  Open a new terminal afterward so `VULKAN_SDK` is set.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows' 260-character path limit used to break the native Vulkan build in
> most checkouts. Since `transcribe-cpp` 0.1.3 the build works around it
> automatically (it compiles through a short NTFS junction — no admin rights
> or setup needed), so a normal checkout just builds. If you still hit
> path-limit errors, see
> [Windows build fails with path-limit errors](#windows-build-fails-with-path-limit-errors-msb3491--ftk1011--msb6003)
> in Troubleshooting.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Abhash-Chakraborty/legato.git
cd legato
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```powershell
bun install
```

### 3. Start Dev Server

```powershell
bun tauri dev
```

### 4. Build for Production

```powershell
bun run tauri build
```

This compiles a release binary and generates the Windows installers (NSIS `.exe` and `.msi`).

## Troubleshooting

### Windows build fails with path-limit errors (`MSB3491` / `FTK1011` / `MSB6003`)

The native build can fail partway through `transcribe-cpp-sys` with
any of these (all the same root cause):

```
error MSB3491: Could not write lines to file "...VCTargetsPath.tlog\VCTargetsPath.lastbuildstate".
Path: ... exceeds the OS max path limit. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters.
```

```
FileTracker : error FTK1011: could not create the new file tracking log file:
...\vulkan-shaders-gen-build\...\cmTC_xxxxx.tlog\link.write.1.tlog.
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

```
error MSB6003: The specified task executable "CL.exe" could not be run.
System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path ...
```

This is **not** a code or toolchain problem — it's Windows' legacy 260-character
path limit (`MAX_PATH`), overflowed by the Vulkan shader generator's nested
CMake build tree on top of Cargo's already-deep
`target\release\build\<crate>-<hash>\out\build\...` directory.

Since `transcribe-cpp` 0.1.3 this is mitigated automatically: the native build
compiles through a short NTFS junction under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tcs` (created
without admin rights), so a normal checkout builds with no setup. Enabling
Windows long paths does **not** reliably help here — MSBuild's native
`FileTracker` (`tracker.exe`) ignores the long-paths flag — which is why the
junction, not the registry flag, is the fix.

If you still see the errors above, junction creation was likely blocked
(filesystem or corporate policy) — the failing build's log then contains a
`transcribe-cpp-sys: could not create short build junction ...` warning — or
your checkout is deep enough to overflow even the shortened layout. Work
around either case with a short Cargo target directory:

```powershell
# Per-shell:
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "C:\h"

# Or persist it for all future terminals (note: redirects ALL your
# Rust projects' build output, not just Legato):
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('CARGO_TARGET_DIR', 'C:\h', 'User')
```

Artifacts then land in `C:\h\release\...` instead of the repo's
`src-tauri\target\`. Open a **new terminal** if you persisted the variable —
it is only picked up by freshly started processes. Then `bun run tauri dev`
and `bun run tauri build` work normally.

### Windows `tauri build` fails at bundling with `program not found`

If the build compiles all the way to `Built application at: ...\legato.exe` and
then fails with:

```
Signing C:\...\legato.exe with a custom signing command
failed to bundle project `program not found`
```

that's the code-signing step: `tauri.conf.json` configures a custom
`signCommand` (`trusted-signing-cli`, Azure Trusted Signing) that only exists
in the release CI environment. Local development doesn't need it:

```powershell
# Development (no bundling/signing at all):
bun run tauri dev

# Or compile a release binary without the installer/signing step:
bun run tauri build --no-bundle
```
